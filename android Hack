This hack provides root level access to insert and allow burpsuite ssl certificate

Export the certificate in der format

Open the certificate. Convert it to base64 encoded PEM format. Save it as “burp.cer”. It should look like this.

convert it in linux or there are online tools 


First we need to rename our certificate file to “<hash>.0” . For generating hash just run this command. Then rename “burp.cer” file to “9a5ba575.0”.

openssl x509 -inform PEM -subject_hash_old -in burp.cer | head -n -1


openssl x509 -in cacert.der -inform DER -out burp.crt



$ adb shell
$ su
# whoami
root

Create a separate temp directory, to hold the current certificates
* mkdir -m 700 /wherever/you/want

Copy the existing certificates
* cp /system/etc/security/cacerts/* /wherever/you/want/

Create an in-memory mount
* mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /system/etc/security/cacerts

Copy the existing certs back into the tmpfs mount
* mv /wherever/you/want/* /system/etc/security/cacerts/

Copy the new certificate, the cert file should be named in the hash.0 format.
* mv /path/to/cert/hash.0 /system/etc/security/cacerts/

Update the perms & selinux context labels, so everything is as readable as before.
* chown root:root /system/etc/security/cacerts/*
chmod 644 /system/etc/security/cacerts/*
chcon u:object_r:system_file:s0 /system/etc/security/cacerts/*
